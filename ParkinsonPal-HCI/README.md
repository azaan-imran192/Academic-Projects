# 🧠 ParkinsonPal — HCI Project

**ParkinsonPal** is a **patient-centric mobile application concept** designed to support individuals living with **Parkinson’s disease** through personalized care, accessibility-focused interactions, and cognitive engagement.

This project was developed as part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course at **Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)** and follows a **human-centered design process** spanning **user research, design, and usability evaluation**.

## 📌 Project Motivation

Parkinson’s disease presents unique challenges related to:
- Motor impairments (tremors, reduced precision)
- Cognitive decline
- Medication adherence
- Emotional well-being and independence

Existing digital solutions often fail to adequately address **accessibility**, **simplicity**, and **local user needs**, particularly for elderly users.

**ParkinsonPal** aims to bridge this gap by designing an **accessible, low-cognitive-load, and culturally relevant solution** tailored for Parkinson’s patients and their caregivers.

## 🧩 Key Features (Conceptual)

- 💊 **Medication reminders** and adherence tracking  
- 📈 **Symptom and progress logging**  
- 🧠 **Cognitive exercises and memory games**  
- 🏃 **Exercise and therapy guidance** (live / recorded)  
- 📅 **Appointment scheduling**  
- 🎙️ **Voice-assisted interactions**  
- 🌐 **Bilingual support (English & Urdu)**  

> ⚠️ This repository documents the **design and evaluation** of the system, not a production-ready implementation.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project follows a **three-phase HCI workflow**:

### 🔍 01 — User Research
- Stakeholder interviews (patients, caregivers, doctors, physiotherapists)
- Questionnaires and qualitative insights
- Problem identification and requirement gathering

📁 `01-User-Research/`

---

### 🎨 02 — Design
- Ideation and brainstorming
- Low-fidelity sketches
- High-fidelity prototypes
- Design alternatives and storyboards
- Accessibility-focused design documentation

📁 `02-Design/`

---

### 📊 03 — Evaluation
- Pre-test and post-test questionnaires
- Task-based usability testing
- User feedback analysis
- Ethical considerations and privacy-aware reporting

📁 `03-Evaluation/`

---

## 🎯 Design Principles

- **Accessibility-first design**
- **Minimal cognitive and motor load**
- **Large touch targets & clear navigation**
- **Simple language and familiar metaphors**
- **Respect for privacy and ethical standards**
