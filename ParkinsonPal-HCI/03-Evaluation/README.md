📊 Evaluation 

This folder contains the usability evaluation and user testing artifacts for ParkinsonPal, conducted as part of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course at LUMS.

The goal of this evaluation phase was to assess usability, learnability, accessibility, and overall user experience of the proposed design with representative users.

🎯 Evaluation Objectives

Assess ease of use for elderly users with Parkinson’s disease

Identify usability issues in:

Navigation

Medication management

Symptom tracking

Cognitive games

Measure user satisfaction and confidence using standardized tools

Collect qualitative feedback for design refinement

🧪 Evaluation Methodology

The evaluation was conducted using a task-based usability testing approach, consisting of:

Pre-test questionnaire (user background & expectations)

Guided task execution using a test scenario

Post-test questionnaire

System Usability Scale (SUS) survey

Observational notes and verbal feedback

Participants were encouraged to think aloud, take breaks when needed, and freely express confusion or comfort during tasks.
