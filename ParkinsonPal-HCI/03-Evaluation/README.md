# 📊 Evaluation Phase

This folder contains the **usability evaluation and user testing artifacts** for **ParkinsonPal**, conducted as part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course at **LUMS**.

The evaluation phase focused on assessing **usability, learnability, accessibility, and overall user experience** of the proposed design with representative users, including elderly individuals and Parkinson’s patients.

---

## 🎯 Evaluation Objectives

- Assess ease of use for elderly users with Parkinson’s disease  
- Identify usability issues related to:
  - Navigation
  - Medication management
  - Symptom tracking
  - Cognitive exercises
- Measure user satisfaction and confidence using structured evaluation tools  
- Validate whether the design meets accessibility and inclusivity goals  

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Methodology

The evaluation was conducted using a **mixed-methods approach**, combining:

- **Pre-test questionnaires** to understand user background and expectations  
- **Task-based usability testing** using the high-fidelity prototype  
- **Post-test questionnaires** to measure perceived usability and satisfaction  
- **Qualitative feedback** through observations and open-ended responses  

Participants were guided through representative tasks such as:
- Logging symptoms
- Navigating medication reminders
- Exploring cognitive exercises
- Reviewing progress dashboards

## 🔍 Key Evaluation Focus Areas

- **Learnability:** Can first-time users complete tasks with minimal guidance?
- **Accessibility:** Are interactions suitable for tremor-affected users?
- **Clarity:** Is the language, iconography, and navigation intuitive?
- **Cognitive Load:** Are tasks simple and non-overwhelming?
- **User Confidence:** Do users feel comfortable using the app independently?

---

## 📌 Ethical Considerations

- Informed consent was obtained prior to evaluation sessions  
- Personally identifiable information (PII) was excluded from this repository  
- Individual patient responses are summarized only in aggregate form  

---

## 📈 Outcome

The evaluation findings informed **design refinements**, validated key usability decisions, and highlighted areas for improvement in accessibility, interaction flow, and cognitive task difficulty.

These insights directly influenced final design recommendations documented in the evaluation report.
