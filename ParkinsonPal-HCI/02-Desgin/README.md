# Design Phase — ParkinsonPal (HCI Project)

This folder documents the **Design Phase** of *ParkinsonPal*, an HCI project focused on creating an accessible, patient-centric mobile application for individuals living with Parkinson’s disease.

The design process translates insights from **user research** into concrete interface decisions through sketches, wireframes, prototypes, and accessibility-driven design documentation.

---

## 🎯 Design Objectives

- Transform user research insights into usable interface flows
- Minimize cognitive and motor load for Parkinson’s patients
- Prioritize accessibility, simplicity, and familiarity
- Support both **English and Urdu** users
- Design for elderly users and tremor-affected interactions

---

## 🧠 Ideation & Brainstorming

Early ideation sessions explored:
- Therapy-focused app concepts
- Cognitive exercises and brain games
- Medication reminders and symptom tracking
- Non-tech assistive tools (e.g., smart bands, walking aids)
- Voice-based and chatbot-assisted interactions

**Files:**
- `brainstorming.jpg`
- `brainstormingg.jpg`
- `brainstorminggg.jpg`

These whiteboard sessions helped define the final scope and feature set of ParkinsonPal.

## ✏️ Low-Fidelity Design (Lo-Fi)

Lo-fi sketches were created to rapidly iterate on:
- Screen layouts
- Navigation structure
- Core task flows (symptoms, medication, therapy, games)

**Files:**
- `All lofi screens.pdf`
- `Sketches.pdf`
- `Storyboards.pdf`

These sketches emphasize **flow clarity over visual polish**.

---

## 🎨 High-Fidelity Design (Hi-Fi)

Hi-fi prototypes translate lo-fi concepts into realistic UI screens, focusing on:
- Large touch targets
- Minimal text entry
- Color-coded symptom tracking
- Familiar visual metaphors

**Files:**
- `HiFi Screens.pdf`
- `Figma source file.fig`

## 🔁 Design Alternatives

Multiple interface alternatives were explored before finalizing designs, especially for:
- Medication management flows
- Symptom logging interfaces
- Navigation patterns

**File:**
- `Design Alternatives.pdf`

---

## ♿ Accessibility-First Design

Accessibility considerations were embedded throughout the design process, including:
- Large buttons and spacing (for tremors)
- Reduced animation and motion
- Voice input support (system-level)
- Screen reader compatibility
- High-contrast visuals
- Emoji-assisted feedback

**File:**
- `Accessibility_Documentation_App.pdf`

This document details how ParkinsonPal supports users with **motor, cognitive, visual, and auditory impairments**.

---

## 📄 Consolidated Design Documentation

Formal design reports submitted as part of the course:

- `Group08_Design2025.pdf`
- `Group08_Design2025.docx`

These include rationale, flows, and final design decisions.
